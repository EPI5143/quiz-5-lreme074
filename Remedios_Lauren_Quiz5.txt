for the proportions of diabetes hospital admissions...*/
/* Based on this output, I know some of my previous code is not correct...however I cannot figure out exactly 
where I went wrong (I think it was the transpose step but it could have potentially been the merge?) and have tried multiple times 
to fix this but I believe I have some of the correct steps, perhaps not in the correct order*/
